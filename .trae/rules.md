## about

this is a project to generate brushes as abr files. it works as a "synthesizer": user set some args, it can generate certain patterns using some algorithms. the args are set by slides. the brushes should be able to be used for krita, ps and csp etc. thats why it is called brush-synth. the idea comes from synthesizers that are used for designing sounds in music industry.
